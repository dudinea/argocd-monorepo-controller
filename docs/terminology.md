# Terminology

## Monorepo 

In GitOPS a **Monorepo** is a single Git repository that contains all
the declarative configurations (manifests) for an entire operational
environment, including applications, services, and infrastructure.

In this document we will use the term **Monorepo** to refer to such an
ArgoCD configurations where there are there two or more Applications tracking
different directories in the same branch of the same Git repository,
or even an ArgoCD Application that shares same branch in Git Repository 
with unrelated files that may be changed.

## Change Revision

**Change Revision** is a Git commit that caused a change in the
manifests generated by an ArgoCD application. 

## Git Revision

**Git Revision** is the current commit in the branch that an ArgoCD 
Application is tracking. This commit may or may not cause changes 
in the manifests generated by that ArgoCD application. 

## ArgoCD Multisource Applications

**Argo CD multisource applications** allow to specify multiple
sources for a single application. Argo CD compiles all the sources and
reconciles the combined resources. Those sources may refer to different
Git repositories, therefore each source may have its own separate
**Change Revision** and **Git Revision**.
